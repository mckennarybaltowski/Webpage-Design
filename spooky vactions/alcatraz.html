<p>The federal prison on Alcatraz Island in the chilly waters of California’s 
	San Francisco Bay housed some of America’s most difficult and dangerous felons
	during its years of operation from 1934 to 1963.
	Among those who served time at the maximum-security facility were the notorious
	gangster Al “Scarface” Capone (1899-1947) and murderer Robert “Birdman of Alcatraz” 
	Stroud (1890-1963).</p>

<!--some creepy ghost stories-->
<p> The real ghost stories that have come out of Alcaraz Island are chilling and almost
	hard to believe.  Alcatraz was originally constructed as a civil war fort.  Points of interest 
	include the site of the 2-day prison revolt known as the Battle of Alcatraz.  Today, 
	people have reported hearing gunfire and weeping in that same area.  In Cell Block D, 
	or solitary confinement area, a visitor reportedly had startling physical contact with 
	a spirit.  Other reports include the apparition of a prisoner with glaring red eyes!  
	In the Citadel, or dungeon, people have been heard screaming.  And in the hospital area, 
	the ghost of notorious prisoner Robert Straud, a.k.a. the Birdman of Alcatraz, is often 
	spotted roaming the area.</p>
